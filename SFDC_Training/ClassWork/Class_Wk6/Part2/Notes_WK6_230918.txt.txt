CMU
Anyone who has to login to SU app shd hv a valid salesforce user id.
when u create a new user id--it has to be attached to a profile---mandatory
profile is always linked to a salesforce license...different license types
5000 students--5000 user licenses--salesforce platform is enough
100 professors-salesforce platform is enough
10 HODs-salesforce platform is enough
1-Dean/Principal-salesforce platform is enough
salesforce licenses is not required coz we are notusing sales cloud,service cloud etc-admin can hv...
How do i decide or restrict or implement the security requirements in the system...
Principal/Dean--can see all student records,make changes,all marks...
Prof---Deptt.-he shd see all student records in his deptt..may be u want to restrict him from seeing other deptt. student records
HOD-can see all student records--have privileges of Prof+few additional stuff
Student-he can see only his record...& his own marks & his own activity & request details...
How to control access to records that people do not own???
what shd be the security setting of the student master & mark records???
sharing settings--OWD--
================================================================================
If you hv a master-detail relationship betwn. 2 objects,say student master & marks..
You hv to set the Object level,Field level,Tab level settings in the Profile for master & marks separately
But OWD--security settings--record security inherits the settings from the master/parent object
================================================================================
org structure..hierarchy..reporting structure..in your org..
by virtue of your position in the org. u can see records owned by ur subordinates
Prof1 is on vacation/holidays..Prof1 user will be on Freeze
Prof1 is leaving..he has to h/o all records he owns to Prof2
Prof2 has to takeup all the ownership
---Mass Transfer
is done by sys admin instead of manual sharing by the record owner..
mass transfer can only be done for 
leads
ac
contracts
& custom objects
--open up access vertically to people above
open up access horizontally/laterally to your peers..
===================================================================================

Permission Set...why do we need it..
Professor-1000-Profile 1
HOD-50--Profile 2
Principal-1--Profile 3

Security requirements of HOD=Professor+Delete permission
HOD=Profile 1+Permission Set 1
-----Lets say the Principal is on leave for 6 months
For 6 months you can assign the Principal permision set to 1 of the HODs or Prof. who is going to act as a Principal...
Total security settings for a user==Profile+PSET1+PSET2+PSET3+PSET4
Total security settings for a user==Profile+PSET1-PSET2-PSET3-PSET4---NOT POSSIBLE-ONLY ADDITION IS POSSIBLE
Can we use permission set to reduce some privileges associated with a profile & assign to a person??NO
----------------------BUSINESS LOGIC-----------------------------
We calculated age based on DOB & current date

----------------------------------------
STUDENT MASTER--BASED ON THE DEPTT.,WE WOULD LIKE TO CAPTURE SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
FOR EG.,IF STUDENT IS FROM CSE,ECE--WE WILL CHECK & CAPTURE IF THE STUDENT KNOWS JAVA OR CSHARP..--2 FIELDS
OTHER DEPTT.S-CHECK & CAPTURE SOME OTHER DETAILS...--1 0R 2 FIELDS
HOW TO CONTROL DISPLAY OF FIELDS ON THE PAGE LAYOUT DEPENDING ON THE DEPTT.
2+1 FIELDS ARE PRESENT IN THE OBJECT DEFINITION..BUT WE WANT TO SELECTIVELY POPULATE THEM..
1.Fields hv to be created in the object 1st irrespective of whether u r going to populate them...or not
2.How to control fields displayed-RECORD TYPE & PAGELAYOUT
3.Create new record type--CSE,IT,link it to Profiles that shd see this RTYPE..link it to PAGELAYOUT associated with this RTYPE as well.
4.we have 2 new page layouts..2 new record types..now the next step is to map them..
5.associate the RTYPE & PAGELAYOUTS...
---->In our eg.,we hv mapped same page layout & record type to all profiles
it is also possible to map different record type & pagelayouts to different profiles...
we will be reusing this concept heavily in sales cloud & service cloud modules

A very warm welcome to you all.. Hope you can hear me and see my screen..
=========================================================================
I am trying to create a new student master record from excel sheet..say i want to create 10 new students...
do i hv to supply the record ids??
SOFT DELETE...NOT HARD DELETE(PERMANENT DELETE)
1.Exported data into a CSV file from student master & student marks objects.
2.we used the same export file & used it as a template for import(insert) to insert new records into the DB.
3.we also inserted new records into the marks object which is a related object to the masterobject.
4.we cleaned up the export file to serve as a template for insert.we removed all columns that would be automatically generated by the system at the time of creating a new record
like record id,created date,owner etc.then a few formula fields & rollup summary fields...& even fields that would be update by the wf field update action.
Picklist values work only at the UI layer...but when u supply values that are not present in the picklist from dataloader they are allowed..
Validation rule--it will work fine..it will prevent if u supply wrong values or junk values
ZIP code--validation or some email id is incorrect format--system will not allow
---For performing an update to an existing record in SFDC u hv 2 options...
1.u can provide the record id
2.u can provide the external id field
UPSERT---UPDATE+INSERT
If record in the csv file already exists in the SFDC DB..system will try to perform an update ops..
if record does not exist in the SFDC DB,system will try to perform an insert
If u are loading 1000 record..u will get 1000 mails..so u may not want this to happen..
You can turn off triggers,wf rules or specifically remove the email alerts...look if u need autoresponse rules to fire..turn off
It becomes imp. to understand the order of execution that we covered in module 7 business process automation...
---when u extract records from the student mark object which is a related object to student master..
u hv a relationship field which links the student mark & student master

----------------------------------------Reports & Dashboards-------------------------------------
1.Summary report format provides a tabular listing of data with dorting & sub-totalling of said data.May be used to support dashboard components.
2.Tabular report provides a simple listing of your data w/o sub-totals.
3.Matrix report summarizes data in a grid against horizontal & vertical criteria.It provides totals for both rows & cloumns.It may also be used to support dashboard components.
4.Joined report can contain data from multiple std. & custom report types.u can add report types to a joined report if theyve a relationships with the same object or objects.
For eg.,if youve a joined report that contains the oppty report type,u can add the cases report type as well coz both hv a relationship with the ac object.a joined report consists of upto 
5 report blocks which u can add to the report to create multiple views of your data.
we customised an existing report,changed the type to summary,tabular etc... & saved in the public folder
How to create a new report?
Records displayed in the report will be based on the overall security settings like OWD,CBS,Role/role hierarchy etc..
when you click on the tab--student master we are seeing all the student master records..
but look at your report..
Security of report folders are similar to what we do in windows folders...you are providing access to see the contents in the folder..
you can add users,groups,roles..but role hierarchy does not work here..
For eg.,if u add a role SUStudent..it does not eman that SUProf. & SUHOD will automatically get access to this folder...
Dasboards(20 components)
1.summary
2.matrix report types is used to create dashboards
not for tabular reports
4 types of dashboards
1.table-top5,bottom5 lists
2.charts-eg. bar charts,line charts,pie charts etc.
3.gauge-to show progress towards a goal
4.metric-single no.
If dashboard is saved as run as specified user--say admin user--even though prof. or student logsin,he iwll be running the dashboard as admin
A running user overrides the sharing model & will allow the users who see the dashboards to see high level sales data for everyone,not just their own.a running user determines
the level of access to the dashboard data.
profile level & permission set security settings for reports & dashboards
---Historical trending reports-Enable users to report on changes to records in this object over time.
reporting snapshots..Reporting snapshots allow users to run reports and save the report results as records on custom objects. Unlike reports, users can schedule reporting snapshots to summarize data at specific times, 
and work with the summarized data similarly to how they work with other records in Salesforce.

------------------SF1 & LIGHTNING-------------------
In 2013 they launched salesforce mobile f/w...they also launched salesforce 1 APIs-force.com,heroku,excattarget(fuel)
Mobile UI is run on aura f/w..the same thing has been extended to the browser as well..LIGHTNING..
2015-This is a new UI f/w on the browser..
Response UI-RWD-Responsive web design--if u open ina tab,the page fits to the viewing area(VIEWPORT) of the tab--form factor
in smartphone...fits...,browser on desktop--fits to that 
CLASSIC UI..
LIGHTNING UI...
both are available u can switch..
-------------------Application Development Lifecycle-----------------------------
1.Requirement Gathering
2.Requirement GAP Analysis
3.Feasibility check & estimate
4.Planning & Design
5.Project Building
6.Test(4-5-4-5-...)
7.UAT
8.Go Live!!
-----------------Different Dev Environments------------------
1.Sandbox is nothing but a replica of production(live)environment!!!it is used for building any project in SF instaed of directly working on live environemnt,to avoid any possible risk.
2.Production(Live)
--------------Best Practices for Project cycle & Deployment---------------
SB>>>min.01
Production>>>always 01
a.SB>>>Dev/Testing/UAT>>>Production
b.SB>>>Dev>>>SB>>>Testing/UAT>>>Production
c.SB>>>Dev>>>SB>>>Testing>>>SB>>>UAT>>Production
d.SB>>India>>>SB>>>US>>>SB>>>UK>>ISB>>>Dev>>>SB>>>Testing>>>SB>>>Staging>>>>Production
-------------------Deployment-Migration of apps & components---------------------
Available Sandboxes
1.Developer
2.Developer Pro
3.Partial Copy
4.Full copy
-----------Project Deployment Process------------
1.Purchase SFs paid edition
--after making payment,we get production access & we cannot let developer/admin to work on production directly.hence we create SB.
2.Login to production,create SB.
3.Login to SB to start building your project work.
If your Production login details are
URL:login.salesforce.com
UN:abc@gmail.com
PW:123
then,to login into SB(name:demosb2) we need to use
URL:test.salesforce.com
UN:abc@gmail.com.demosb2
PW:123
4.build the project by creating things like apps,object etc.
5.prepare a connection betwn. sanding & recieving by 'Deployment Settings'.Its like handshaking activity.
select the needed checkbox at SB.
do the same from production & connection will be set betwn. them
6.prepare a suitcase/change set,i.e.,o/b change set from SB.this will add project & content from SB to Production.
7.add all elements in suitcase
8.upload the change set.
9.go to production
10.u will see the entry of this,in production under 'i/b change sets'
11.see the components if u want to check what all elements coming from SB in that.
12.verify by using validate button(imp)
13.perform deployment by 'Deploy' button
14.Done!!!!

---------------------------Introduction to Apex-----------------------------------
1.Apex syntax is similar to java.
2.Apex has classes,inheritance,polymorphism & other aspects of OOPs.
3.Apex is strongly typed,compiled,highly scalable,secure & runs natively on the SFDC platform.
4.apex directly saves & runs on the SFDC platform.
5.apex is a template based language.
6.it is governed language as it executes in a multitenant environment.
we were trying to validate if a student has passed in a subject,then ensure the system does not allow duplicate values
i want to summarise the list of all marks in a sem & send out a report--
rollup summary field--which will show a list of subjects failed,passed,total marks etc.
From the UI-You want to edit multiple records
web2student-create student records from another website..
email2student
apex is a strongly typed....we hv seen data types...u need to mention the data types of the variable...
validation rule,rollup summary,wf rules,formula fields,all other rules will be fired when a record is inserted or updated from the UI,from data loader or data import wizard,from a apex class.
PERFORMING A DML OPERATION
to perform an insert just 2 lines of code
1.declare a sobject variable of the type of record/object that you are going to insert.
2.populate the values into the fields in the object.
3.insert statement.

what is required to perform an update..
1.declare a sobject variable of the type of record/object that you are going to update.
2.does the sobject variable contain the record i need to update for eg.--apex1@apex.com-SOQL
3.update statement

//a is a sobject of type Account...is a std object....
//This is my first line of Apex code
Account a = new account(Name='creating a new account on 23092018');
insert a;//Insert is a DML operation

 
SUStudentMaster__c stud = new SUStudentMaster__c(SUStudentMailid__c='samirwhig23092018@gmail.com',SUStudentStatus__c='ACTIVE');  
insert stud;//Insert is a DML operation

SUStudentMaster__c stud = [SELECT Id,Name FROM SUStudentMaster__c WHERE SUStudentMailid__c='samirwhig230972018@gmail.com'];
stud.SUStudentStatus__c='SUSPENDED';
stud.SUStudentDeptt__c='TEXTILE';
update stud;//Update is a DML operation

SQL-STRUCTURED QUERY LANGUAGE-ORACLE,SYBASE,SQL SERVER ETC.
SOQL-SALESFORCE OBJECT QUERY LANGUAGE
DEVELOPER CONSOLE
HOW TO SEE THE DEBUG LOG
EXECUTE ANONYMOUS BLOCK..
---Controlling Statements
1.if
if(condition){
//this code runs when condition is true
}
integer age;
//assume you got age value from user
    age=17;
    if(age>=18){
//this code runs when condition is true
    system.debug('Congrats!You are eligible to vote!!');
            }
    if(age<18){
//this code runs when condition is true
        system.debug('Sorry!You are not eligible to vote!!');
    }
2.if-else
   
    integer age;
    //assume you got age value from user
    age=54;
    if(age>=18){
        //this code runs when condition is true
        system.debug('Congrats!You are eligible to vote!!');
            }
    else{
        //this code runs when condition is true
        system.debug('Sorry!You are not eligible to vote!!');
    }
3.if-elseif
//if-elseif
string country;
if(country="India"){
//code
}
elseif(country="US"){
//code
}
elseif(country="UK"){
//code
}
elseif(country="Japan"){
//code
}
-----Looping statements
1.do while
//---------------do while looping statements---------------------
    string country;
    country='India';
    do{
        system.debug('I love my country');
    }while(country=='USA');
2.while
//--------------While looping statements------------------------------
    string country;
    country='India';
    while(country=='India'){
        system.debug('I love my country');
    }
3.for loop
//-----------------for(Counter;Condition;Increment/Decrement) loop-------------------------
    for(integer i=1;i<21;i+1){
        system.debug('I love my country');
    }
--------------------public class ApexClassForVoting {
//variable declaration in apex
    integer age;
//method in apex
    public void MyFunction(){
    //assume you got age value from user
    age=20;
    if(age>=18){
        //this code runs when condition is true
        system.debug('Congrats!You are eligible to vote!!');
            }
    else{
        //this code runs when condition is not true
        system.debug('Sorry!You are not eligible to vote!!');
    }
}
}
-------------------------Apex triggers-------------------------------
when a DML is performed...INSERT or UPDATE...WF rule is fored to check few validations..or perform  some field update...send an email alert etc.
If age is <17yrs....based on DOB...u cannot allow the student record to be created---validation rule.
Lets say u hv to verify the DOB of the student by calling say the AADHAR CARD DB...WHICH IS EXTERNAL..or SSN...EXTERNAL SYSTEM...where u want to verify...
u may hv 2 options...1 is to verify immediately real-time & prevent the record from being created
or u can insert the record...make a call to the SSN or AADHAR CARD DB..comes back after a 1 day..invalidate the student status...
you want to perform a unique record check..for eg.,emailid+phone+fathers name+student name+passport no...u can go for paex trigger..which will validate the record before inserting
For eg,mrks..update the master record with total marks,no. of subjects passed,failed etc..use a trigger AFTER INSERT event to update the master record--its a lookup relationship
& rollup summary cannot be used..
BUSINESS LOGIC=APEX
WHEN TO RUN BUSINESS LOGIC=TRIGGER
APEX CLASS=DISCOUNT
EVENTS & TYPES OF TRIGGER
A.BEFORE
AFTER
B.DML OPS.
INSERT
UPDTE
DELETE
UNDELETE
Trigger best parctices
1.always hv 1 trigger per 1 object.
2.never write business logic in trigger
3.always try to hv 1 class for 1 trigger(1:1mapping)such a class is called as trigger handler.
trigger PenDiscountTrigger on Pen__c (before insert) {
PenClassDemonstration.applyDiscount(Trigger.new); 
}

public class PenClassDemonstration{    
    public static void applyDiscount(list<Pen__c> PensListNew) {        
      for (Pen__c p :PensListNew){
        if(p.Price__c >= 100){
            p.Price__c = p.Price__c-20 ;
   
            }
      }
    }
}
WF Rule works on only 1 record..at a timne...
200 record update/inserted--trigger will get all the 200 records & it will process all records 1 by 1---by default all triggers are bulkified..they can handle bulk records
500 records???--batches--200 1st execution...200 2nd execution & 100 3rd execution
-----------------------DB Queries in SF--------------------
In SF,wehv 2 query languages
SOQL-QUERY FORMAT
SOSL
[SELECT Name,Max_salary__c FROM Position__c WHERE Status__c='open']
2 types of SOQL queries
1.[]expressions are enclosed in a [] brackets
2.string based queries are written in string form & are passed as a parameter to DB query method to be executed.
SOQL queries can return the following 3 types of data
1.list of sobjects
2.single sobject
3.integer

SOQL fn.s are also called 'aggregate fn.s' as they show a calculated result from a query
SUM()
MIN()
MAX()
COUNT() & COUNT(FILE NAME)
AVG()
Major keywords used in SOQL queries
IN
AND/OR
ORDER BY
LIMIT
LIKE
NOT 
GROUP BY
FOR UPDATE
SELECT name FROM Pen__c WHERE name='Praveen'
