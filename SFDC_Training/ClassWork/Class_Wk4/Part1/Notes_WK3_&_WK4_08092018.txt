one relationship is towards the student master
second relationship is towards the activity master
look & feel & security...will be inherited from the 1st master-detail relationship
Junction Object--MTM

YOU SEE DIFFERENT APPS,TABS,OBJECTS,RECORDS ARE INSIDE THE OBJECTS

WHO ARE THE KEY USERS...
WHAT PRIVILEGES SHD THEY HV?
WHO CAN SEE WHAT???

STUDENTS
PROFESSORS(LECTURERS)
HOD
PRINCIPAL/DEAN/SR. MGMT.

Profile???contains user permissions & access settings that control what users can do within their org.
Std Profiles
sys admin
std. platform user
std user
soln manager
mktg manager
contract manager
read only etc.
Points to remember
1.every user MUST be assigned to a profile.
2.access permissions to objects(& fields) of std profiles cannot be edited.
3.std profiles hv access to all std objects
4.access to tabs & apps can be configured for std profiles
5.access permissions of custom profiles can be edited.
custom profiles are just a clone of std profiles with some customized settings & permissions.
---License types----
salesforce---SAAS--sales cloud,service cloud etc. modules & underlying std objects like ac,contacts,oppty,cases etc..,u can also see the custom objects..
salesforce platform--PAAS--you can see some of the std objects like ac,contacts,cases,u can also see the custom objects...
chatter free-5000
every user who has to login to SFDC,needs a license..per user based..
500
login.salesforce.com---username is linked to 1 org id...email id can be linked to multiple orgs..
user license-this is every user shd hv it-compulsory
feature license-optional
CU-only needs platform licenses..500-1000 students+prof.. etc
10-salesforce--admin & sr mgmt...
salesforce content & knowledge--u can use this to share docs,assignments...or hv a repository
-----
OWD defines the basic/min. access level for eacj object irrespective of the profile

----------------------------------------
CMU
Anyone who has to login to SU app shd hv a valid salesforce user id.
when u create a new user id--it has to be attached to a profile---mandatory
profile is always linked to a salesforce license...different license types
5000 students--5000 user licenses--salesforce platform is enough
100 professors-salesforce platform is enough
10 HODs-salesforce platform is enough
1-Dean/Principal-salesforce platform is enough
salesforce licenses is not required coz we are notusing sales cloud,service cloud etc-admin can hv...
How do i decide or restrict or implement the security requirements in the system...
Principal/Dean--can see all student records,make changes,all marks...
Prof---Deptt.-he shd see all student records in his deptt..may be u want to restrict him from seeing other deptt. student records
HOD-can see all student records--have privileges of Prof+few additional stuff
Student-he can see only his record...& his own marks & his own activity & request details...
How to control access to records that people do not own???
what shd be the security setting of the student master & mark records???
sharing settings--OWD--
================================================================================
If you hv a master-detail relationship betwn. 2 objects,say student master & marks..
You hv to set the Object level,Field level,Tab level settings in the Profile for master & marks separately
But OWD--security settings--record security inherits the settings from the master/parent object
================================================================================
org structure..hierarchy..reporting structure..in your org..
by virtue of your position in the org. u can see records owned by ur subordinates
Prof1 is on vacation/holidays..Prof1 user will be on Freeze
Prof1 is leaving..he has to h/o all records he owns to Prof2
Prof2 has to takeup all the ownership
---Mass Transfer
is done by sys admin instead of manual sharing by the record owner..
mass transfer can only be done for 
leads
ac
contracts
& custom objects
--open up access vertically to people above
open up access horizontally/laterally to your peers..
===================================================================================
VIEW ALL & MODIFY ALL --PERMISSIONS AT THE OBJECT & PROFILE LEVEL OVERRIDES ALL RECORD SHARING SETTINGS--EVEN IF OWD IS PVT.,USER BELONGS TO THIS PROFILE CAN SEE ALL RECORDS IN THE OBJECT

Permission Set...why do we need it..
Professor-1000-Profile 1
HOD-50--Profile 2
Principal-1--Profile 3

Security requirements of HOD=Professor+Delete permission
HOD=Profile 1+Permission Set 1
-----Lets say the Principal is on leave for 6 months
For 6 months you can assign the Principal permision set to 1 of the HODs or Prof. who is going to act as a Principal...
Total security settings for a user==Profile+PSET1+PSET2+PSET3+PSET4
Total security settings for a user==Profile+PSET1-PSET2-PSET3-PSET4---NOT POSSIBLE-ONLY ADDITION IS POSSIBLE
Can we use permission set to reduce some privileges associated with a profile & assign to a person??NO
----------------------BUSINESS LOGIC-----------------------------
We calculated age based on DOB & current date
age cannot be less than 17 yrs.
DOJ cannot be less than 01.01.2018
Address & zipcode-zipcode shd be in the format US-12345,India-123456
SSN/AADHAR-FORMAT
CREDIT CARD/DEBIT CARD-FORMAT
Based on the marks entered you can verify if a student has PASS/FAIL
qualified/not qualified...-create a formula field
Marks shd not be -ve..or greated than 100--0 to 100,-1 or 101 not allowed--validation
FORMULA FIELD VALUES ARE CALCULATED EVEN FOR EXISTING RECORDS...IF THE FORMULA IS CREATED AFTER FEW RECORDS HV BEEN CREATED
VALIDATION RULES WILL BE TRIGGERED WHEN A RECORD IS SAVED..IF THERE ARE EXISTING RECORDS & U OPEN THE RECORD ,VALIDATION RULE WILL NOT CHECK THE RECORD,BUT WHEN YOU EDIT & SAVE THE RECORD THE 
VALIDATION RULE WILL CATCH THE ERROR...
VALIDATION RULES ARE DEFINED AT THE FIELD/OBJECT LEVEL...& EXECUTES WHENEVER A NEW RECORD IS CREATED OR EXISTING RECORD IS EDITED...

---CRUD---
---MULTI-USER & SECURITY---
---MULTI-USERS & SCALABILITY-
I would like to see a summary of all subjects the student has passed--no. of subjects passed,no. of subjects failed...,total marks,avg.(only for subjects passed)--STUDENT MASTER OR MARKS???
IT SHD BE ON THE STUDENT MASTER
----------------------------------------
STUDENT MASTER--BASED ON THE DEPTT.,WE WOULD LIKE TO CAPTURE SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
FOR EG.,IF STUDENT IS FROM CSE,ECE--WE WILL CHECK & CAPTURE IF THE STUDENT KNOWS JAVA OR CSHARP..--2 FIELDS
OTHER DEPTT.S-CHECK & CAPTURE SOME OTHER DETAILS...--1 0R 2 FIELDS
HOW TO CONTROL DISPLAY OF FIELDS ON THE PAGE LAYOUT DEPENDING ON THE DEPTT.
2+1 FIELDS ARE PRESENT IN THE OBJECT DEFINITION..BUT WE WANT TO SELECTIVELY POPULATE THEM..
1.Fields hv to be created in the object 1st irrespective of whether u r going to populate them...or not
2.How to control fields displayed-RECORD TYPE & PAGELAYOUT
3.Create new record type--CSE,IT,link it to Profiles that shd see this RTYPE..link it to PAGELAYOUT associated with this RTYPE as well.
4.we have 2 new page layouts..2 new record types..now the next step is to map them..
5.associate the RTYPE & PAGELAYOUTS...
---->In our eg.,we hv mapped same page layout & record type to all profiles
it is also possible to map different record type & pagelayouts to different profiles...
we will be reusing this concept heavily in sales cloud & service cloud modules

Approvals-short term leave,long term leave(2 level approvers)
loan-mortgage..separation...final day clearance..
parallel approval-all deptt.s hv to approve...
